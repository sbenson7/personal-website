			    	I cofounded Study Clash, an educational mobile and web application that gamifies studying. Study Clash converts notes into multiple-choice trivia games so that students can learn classroom material as they compete with their friends. In addition to conceiving the idea for Study Clash, I led the front-end development and design of the web application, built using Ruby on Rails. I also designed the gameâ€™s avatars and contributed to the iOS and Android apps using React Native. Study Clash won Binghamton University's Idea Pitch Competition and the Mason Emerging Innovators Award at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. It participated in the Cardozo Tech Startup Clinic and the Accelerate WPI program.
