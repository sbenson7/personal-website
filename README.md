# Hi there! Welcome to my personal website!
I used it to get a little practice using React, getting started with this tutorial (https://medium.com/@Preda/getting-started-on-building-a-personal-website-with-react-b44ee93b1710) and then making it my own!



## Tech stack
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) & [React Router 4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [Node](https://github.com/nodejs) & [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
